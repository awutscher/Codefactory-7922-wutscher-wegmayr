        <h1>International Moose Count Underway</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">By BOB BOBSTON</h3>
        <p>The UN-sponsored International
            Moose Census got off to a flying
            start today with hopes for an increase
            in the worldwide moose population
            compared to last year’s disapointing
            figures. Among the traditional early
            reporters were Egypt, returning figures of six moose, a twenty percent
            increase on 2011’s figures of five, and
            Uruguay whose moose population remains stable at eleven.
        </p>
        <p style="color:blue">
            According to Robbie McRobson,
            head of the UN Moose Preservation Council, worldwide moose numbers are expected to grow markedly
            on last year due to the traditional
            moose strongholds of Canada and the
            United States, with the larger developing moose ecologies also poised
            to make gains. The largest percentagege increase in moose will likely
            come from China’’, says McRobson,
            The Chinese government has invested
            heavily in moose infrastructure over
            the past decade, and their committment to macrofauna is beginning to
            pay dividends’’. Since 2004 China has
            expanded moose pasture from 1.5%
            of arable land to nearly 3.648% and
            moose numbers are expected to rise
            to 60,000 making China a net moose
            exporter for the first time. This is
            good news for neighbouring Mongolia, a barren moose-wasteland whose
            inhabitents nonetheless have an insatiable desire for the creatures. The increase in Beijing-Ulanbataar trade is
            anticipated to relieve pressure on the
            relatively strained Russian suppliers,
            but increase Mongolia’s imbalance of
            trade with its larger neighbour.

            Historically the only competitor
            to China in the far eastern moose
            markets has been Singapore but the
            tiny island nation is set to report a
            net loss, expecting a decrease of more
            than five percent on last year’s 50,000 Moose counted. The head of Singapore’s Agency for Agriculture, JingFeng Lau, explained to an incredulous Singaporean parliament yesterday that bad weather had contributed
            to this season’s poor showing, most
            notably when a cargo of 150 moose
            were swept out into the Indian ocean
            in a monsoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet again the global demand for
            moose will be met largely by the
            US and Canada. The recession-hit
            States is taking comfort in its moose
            growth figures with gross production
            expected to break 700,000 and net exports to grow by 2%. The worldwide
            dominance of Canada shows no signs
            of abating though with this year’s
            moose population expected to match
            last year’s record figures of one hundred million billion.

        <p class="red">
            Europe’s rise as an international
            moose power will slow slightly this
            year as a response to the European
            Union’s move towards standardising
            the European moose. Stringent quality controls are holding back the development of the eastern european
            populations compared to last year
            when they contributed significantly
            to europe’s strong growth figures.
            Norway, which is not an EU member
            but has observer status, strengthed
            in numbers relative to the Euro area
            with numbers of Norweigian moose,
            known locally as elk’’ expected to rise
            for the tenth consecutive year, particularly thanks to a strong showing in
            the last quarter.

            As moose season reaches its close,
            researchers world wide are turning to
            science in an attempt to boost next
            year’s figures. NASA stunned the
            scientific community today with the
            announcment of their discovery that
            the moon is significantly smaller than
            previously believed. This conclusion,
            which is the conclusion of a tenyear collaborative project, will have
            profound implications for the moose
            community as the gravitational field
            is now known to be of the right
            strength to support moose in orbit.
            According to John Johnson, head
            of the NASA Moon Sizing Experiment the first delivery of moose into low moon orbit could be achieved as
            early as the third quarter of next year.
            The technology to nurture moose in
            space is available now’’, he said, ’’all
            that is needed is political will’’.
